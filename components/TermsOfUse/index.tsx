        Welcome to PocketMind! These Terms of Use are the rules that keep our
        app running smoothly so you can enjoy smarter, faster, and fun learning
        with AI. By using PocketMind, you agree to follow these terms. If you
        don’t agree, no worries—just don’t use the app.

        1. What You Can Do With PocketMind
      </h2>
      <p>
        PocketMind is here to help you learn better with AI-powered flashcards,
        gamified bots, and offline access. Here’s what we offer and what you can
        do:
      </p>
      <ul style={{ listStyleType: "disc", paddingLeft: "20px" }}>
        <li>Create interactive flashcards from any topic you enter.</li>
        <li>Use bots like YesNo and Swiper for fun, gamified learning.</li>
        <li>Download flashcards to study offline, anytime, anywhere.</li>
        <li>Explore detailed explanations by clicking headings in the app.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We give you a personal, non-exclusive license to use PocketMind for your
        own learning. That means it’s for you—not for reselling or repurposing.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ fontSize: "1.5rem", marginTop: "20px" }}>
        2. Your Responsibilities
      </h2>
      <p>To keep PocketMind awesome for everyone, we ask you to:</p>
      <ul style={{ listStyleType: "disc", paddingLeft: "20px" }}>
        <li>
          Use the app for personal learning, not for anything illegal or
          harmful.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep your account info (like your email and password if we add one
          later) secure—don’t share it with others.
        </li>
        <li>
          Respect our content—don’t copy, sell, or distribute the flashcards or
          bot responses outside of your personal use.
        </li>
        <li>Provide accurate info (like your email) when signing up.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style={{ fontSize: "1.5rem", marginTop: "20px" }}>
        3. What’s Ours Stays Ours
      </h2>
      <p>
        The cool stuff in PocketMind—like the AI, bots, flashcard designs, and
        app layout—is ours. We own the intellectual property, and you’re welcome
        to use it as part of the app, but you can’t claim it as your own or
        reuse it elsewhere without our permission.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your input—like the topics or questions you enter—belongs to you, but by
        submitting it, you give us permission to turn it into flashcards and bot
        responses for your learning (and to improve the app).
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ fontSize: "1.5rem", marginTop: "20px" }}>
        4. Signing Up & Account Stuff
      </h2>
      <p>
        To get started, you’ll need to enter your email. You must be at least 13
        years old to use PocketMind (sorry, younger learners— it’s a legal
        thing). If we add accounts with passwords later, you’re responsible for
        keeping yours safe.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ fontSize: "1.5rem", marginTop: "20px" }}>
        5. Things We’re Not Responsible For
      </h2>
      <p>We work hard to make PocketMind amazing, but:</p>
      <ul style={{ listStyleType: "disc", paddingLeft: "20px" }}>
        <li>
          The app is provided “as is.” We can’t promise it’ll always be perfect
          or error-free (though we’ll do our best).
        </li>
        <li>
          The info in flashcards comes from AI based on your input—it’s meant to
          help you learn, but we’re not liable if it’s not 100% accurate or
          complete.
        </li>
        <li>
          If something goes wrong—like losing offline flashcards due to a device
          issue—that’s on you to back up or troubleshoot.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style={{ fontSize: "1.5rem", marginTop: "20px" }}>6. Playing Nice</h2>
      <p>
        Don’t misuse PocketMind. That means no hacking, no spamming, and no
        trying to break the app. If you do, we can suspend or terminate your
        access. Same goes if you violate these terms.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ fontSize: "1.5rem", marginTop: "20px" }}>
        7. Updates & Changes
      </h2>
      <p>
        We might tweak PocketMind over time—new bots, better flashcards, you
        name it. We can also update these terms. If we do, we’ll notify you in
        the app or via email. Keep using the app after that, and it means you’re
        cool with the changes.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ fontSize: "1.5rem", marginTop: "20px" }}>
        8. Ending Your Use
      </h2>
      <p>
        You can stop using PocketMind anytime—just delete the app or stop
        visiting. We can also end your access if we need to (like if you break
        these rules or we shut down the app). If that happens, your license to
        use it ends too.
      </p>
